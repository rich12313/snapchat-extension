To Do (In no order of Importance)
==================
Create a method to access chrome storage variables from anywhere.

Develop a "first-use" test. Prompts the user to configure the app if it's their first time. 

Group list system. Enables users to create "quick lists". 

Cropping + Image Manipulation. 

GUI redesign (Kinda sucks right now).
